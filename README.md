# 7nm Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Design Project

## Overview

This project involves the design, simulation, synthesis, and physical verification of a custom 3-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using a 7nm technology node. The ALU supports basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) based on a control signal and integrates a custom library of 34 standard cells developed at the same technology node.

## Features

- **Operands**: 3-bit inputs `A` and `B`
- **Reset**: Active-low `reset_n`
- **Select Line**: 1-bit `select` signal  
  - `0`: Performs unsigned addition  
  - `1`: Performs subtraction using twoâ€™s complement
- **Output**: 3-bit result on `F`
